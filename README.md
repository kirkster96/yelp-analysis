# yelp-Analysis

Welcome to our Yelp Analysis project! 

This is a non-commercial research project that aims to analyze
and draw insights from the comprehensive dataset provided by Yelp,
which you can access here:

## What does it do?

This application currently does not do much.

At the time of writing this, Spring Boot is used to simply process the yelp data
and load it into MongoDB.

The current purpose of this code is to learn and practice coding. Especially with Java, Kotlin, and Spring.

## How to use the docker-compose.yml

To run our application in a containerized development environment, we provide a `docker-compose.yml` file. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use this:

**Step 1:** Make sure Docker Desktop is installed on your machine. If it's not, you can download it from the official Docker website.

**Step 2:** Open the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file resides in your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt on Windows).

**Step 3:** Run the following command: `docker compose up -d`.

This command will tell Docker to download and provision all necessary resources as described in the `docker-compose.yml` file, including setting up and running the necessary containers for the services defined in the file in the detached mode.
